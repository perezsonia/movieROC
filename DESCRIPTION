Description: Tools for estimating the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve under different generalizations:
              - making the classification subsets flexible to cover those scenarios where both extremes of the marker 
              are associated with a higher risk of being positive, considering two thresholds (gROC curve);
              - transforming the marker by a function either defined by the user or resulting from a logistic regression
              model (hROC curve);
              - considering a linear transformation with some fixed parameters introduced by the user, dynamic parameters
              resulting from Meisner et al. (2017) approach or empirically maximizing TPR for each FPR for a bivariate marker.
              Also a quadratic transformation with particular coefficients or a function fitted by a logistic regression model
              can be considered (biROC curve);
              - considering a linear transformation with some fixed parameters introduced by the user, dynamic parameters
              resulting from Meisner et al. (2017) approach or a function fitted by a logistic regression model (multiROC curve).
              The classification regions behind each point of the ROC curve are displayed in both fixed graphics (plot.buildROC,
              plot.regions or plot.funregions function) or videos (movieROC function).
